        <p>"We are grateful to the hope organization for the great work they have done in the city of Bangalore to connect the underprivileged with the people who want to help and spread their noble initiative across the city, across all sections of the society. Their presence in this great city will help it not just to be the IT Capital of India but also build the closest free utopian society in India."</p>

            <p>"As the gap between the rich and the poor increases, we require more organizations like Hope to provide every person in this city with the basic amenities that anyone deserves. I call upon on all my colleagues to invest so that we can play our part in building a better society for our children and so that they can make their network even bigger."</p>
