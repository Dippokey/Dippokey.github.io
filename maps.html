     <p id="paragraph">The health and hygiene of the urban poor is one of biggest challenges of our society. With more than 20% percent population living in slums, disease outbreaks can be a cause for concern. People living in such impoverished areas are deprived of filtered drinking water, medical aid, proper clothing, proper garbage disposal system and basic medical aid.
Women living in impoverished areas are often victims of domestic violence and oppression. These women cannot rely on anyone and are stuck in their condition without any help at all.
Education is another problem as boys and especially girls are deprived of proper schooling. This lack of education leads to many boys growing up to become violent unethical men and the women getting exploited, this needs to stop right now.
That is why we are here to provide with the support and voice they need, through monetary help and other facilities that would help them proud independent citizens of this country. We require your support to make their dreams come true.
